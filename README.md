## Getting Started

Firstly, Copy `.env.example` file in the root of the folder and rename it `.env.local`.

Paste OpenWeather api key under `WEATHER_APP_KEY` and use the same MongoDB URI unless a change is required.

```bash
$ docker compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
